## Setup

For guidance on setting up and submitting this assignment, refer to the Marcy lab School Docs How-To guide for [Working with Short Response and Coding Assignments](https://marcylabschool.gitbook.io/marcy-lab-school-docs/fullstack-curriculum/how-tos/working-with-assignments#how-to-work-on-assignments).

After cloning your repository, make sure to run the following commands:

```sh
npm i
git checkout -b draft
npm t
```

## Testing Your Code

### Submitting On Time

You have to understand that "grades" don't exist at Marcy. We only need performance data in order to know how you're doing and make sure the people who need help get it as quickly as they can. It's ok if you don't finish by the deadline! Just show us what you have. We'll have office hours and reviews, and we want to know what you are all struggling with so we can use those meetings effectively. **This is not about grades, it's about seeing what you know and where we can help!**

### playground.js

The most straightforward way to test your code is to test your code by hand as you work. Invoke your functions and use `console.log()` to print out the results. Then, `cd` into the `src/` directory and use the `node <file_name>` command to run your JavaScript files.

You can also create a "playground" (or "sandbox") file where you import any code you need and then mess around with it. We've included one in the `src` directory so you can see it. Run that program using `node src/playground.js`.

### npm test

Before submitting your code, make sure you get things right by running the provided automated tests.

You can do this using the commands:

```sh
npm test # run the automated tests
npm run test:w # run the automated tests and rerun them each time you save a change
```

You will know that you have "completed" an assignment once you have passed 75% or more of the automated tests!

## Overview

In this assignment, you will be tasked with completing the data management portion of an application.

![a fruit stand application with an inventory and a cart. users can add items to the cart which shows the total price.](./images/final-app.png)

### User Stories

Upon completing this assignment, the user should be able to:

- Browse a list of fruits available for purchase
- Click on a fruit to add it to their cart
- See the total price of all items in their cart
- Click on an item in the cart to remove it.

### Starting Code

> Remember to run `npm i` to install the dependencies!

To start this assignment, you will be given a Vite project with all rendering and user event logic implemented for you in the `vite-project` folder! Check out what you are starting with by running `npm run dev` and then browsing through the `src/main.js` file and the `src/utils/` folder.

Your job is to build the two classes:

- `ShoppingCart` in the `src/model/ShoppingCart.js` file
- `CartItem` in the `src/model/CartItem.js` file

Only the `ShoppingCart` class is directly used by the rest of the application (see `src/main.js` and `src/utils/render-functions.js`). However, the `CartItem` class must be used by the `ShoppingCart`.

### Testing

Below, you will find descriptions of the classes you need to build however, you should read the test files carefully to see how we expect each class to behave. We recommend having the `ShoppingCart.spec.js` and `CartItem.spec.js` files open while you develop.

As you work, use `npm run test:w` to have the test file continuously re-run as you update your code.

Before you finish, run the program (`npm run dev`) to ensure that your classes provide a usable interface for the rest of the application. Check the user stories above and make sure that the user is able to actually use this application.

**Reminder**: We are using ES Modules!

Because we are using ES Modules and working in the front end, you cannot test your files individually in Node (the terminal in VS code or otherwise). Make sure that you are using the console in the browser when playing with your code.

Let's get started! You got this!

## Part 1: Cart Item

Below, you will find the requirements for each class. You can test your class using `npm test` or `npm run test:w`

The instructions here are intentionally vague. Look at the associated `CartItem.spec.js` files to see how we are using your class!

Create a `CartItem` class.

It should have the following instance properties:

- `id`: a unique value generated from the getId helper function
- `name`: the given name of the item
- `price`: the given price of the item

## Part 2: Shopping Cart Instance Properties/Methods

Create a `ShoppingCart` class.

Each `ShoppingCart` instance should have the following properties:

- `id`: a unique value generated from the getId helper function (it should not be private)
- `#cartItems`: a **private** array of `CartItem`s held by the `ShoppingCart` instance

Each `ShoppingCart` instance should have the following methods:

- `createItem(name, price)`: creates a new CartItem and adds it to the instance's cart
- `getItems()`: returns the array of items held by this `ShoppingCart` instance
- `removeItem(id)`: removes an item from the instance's cart based on the given id
- `getTotal()`: returns the total price of all items held by this `ShoppingCart` instance

## Part 3: Shopping Cart Class Properties/Methods

The `ShoppingCart` class should have the following `static` properties:

- `#allCarts`: a private array of all `ShoppingCart` instances

The `ShoppingCart` class should have the following `static` methods:

- `listAll()`: returns a copy of the array of all `ShoppingCart` instances
- `findBy(id)`: returns the `ShoppingCart` instance with the given `id`
